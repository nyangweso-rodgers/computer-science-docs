# O(N): Linear
* An algorithm that is __O(N)__ will take as many steps as there are elements of data. 

* So when an array increases in size by one element, an __O(N) algorithm__ will increase by one step. i.e., the __output__ is directly proportional to the __input__.

* __O(N)__ is a perfect _diagonal line_, as for every additional piece of data, the algorithm takes one additional step. This is why it is also referred to as __linear time__.

* _Example include_: Traverse an array and print each element.
