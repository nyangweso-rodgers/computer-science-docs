# O(N²):  Quadratic
* __O(N²)__ represents the _complexity of an algorithm_, whose performance is proportional to the square of the size of the input elements.

* It is generally quite slow: If the input array has 1 element it will do 1 operation, if it has 10 elements it will do 100 operations, and so on.

* Adding more nested iterations through the input will increase the algorithm’s complexity: e.g. if the number of iterations is 3 then its complexity will be O(N³) and so forth. Usually, we want to stay away from polynomial running times (quadratic, cubic, Nˣ, etc).

* The O(N²) line is a sharp curve

* _Examples include_: Find duplicates in an array
