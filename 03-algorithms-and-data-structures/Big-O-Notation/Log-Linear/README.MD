# O(N logN): Log-linear
* An algorithm of this complexity class is doing __log(N)__ work N times and therefore its performance is slightly worse than O(N). 
* Many practical algorithms belong in this category (from _sorting_, to _pathfinding_, to _compression_), so we are mentioning it for completeness. 
* _Example_: is a __Merge Sort__ it is a ‘__Divide and Conquer__’ algorithm: it divides the input array in two halves, calls itself for each one and then merges the two sorted halves. its __Scalability__ is Average.
