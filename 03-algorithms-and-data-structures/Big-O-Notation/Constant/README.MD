# O(1): Constant
* __O(1)__ means that the algorithm takes the same number of steps to execute regardless of how much data is passed in. i.e., the __output__ is constant and is not affected by the __input__.

* If we were to represent the number of steps (y-axis) vs the number of input elements (x-axis), __O(1)__ is a perfect __horizontal line__, since the number of steps in the algorithm remains constant no matter how much data there is. This is why it is called __constant time__.
