# Introduction to Data Structures
* __Data Structure__ is the arrangement of data in computer's memory such that it could make the data quickly available to the processor for required calculations. 

* The functional definition of a __data structure__ is known as __ADI__ (__Abstract Data Type__) which is independent  of implementation. The implementation  part is left for developers who decide which technology better suits to their project needs.

# Definition of Terms
1. __The Node__: This is the most basic building block for many common data structures. The node fulfills two functions:
    - _provides a mechanism to contain a piece of data_ e.g., an integer value 7.
    - _it provides a means of connecting itself to other nodes via object reference pointer_.This object reference point is referred to as _Next Pointer_.

2. __Trees__: are similary to __Linked list__ in that they chain together nodes of data, but they do it in a hierarchical rather than in a linear manner.

# Abstract Data Structures
* __Abstract Data Structures__ (ADS) are a higher level concept used to describe a specific behavior or set of operations that a data structure should support. ADS provides a mathematical model for representing data structures and their operations, independent of any particular implementation.

* For example, the stack and queue are abstract data structures that can be implemented using different underlying data structures such as arrays or linked lists.

* Therefore, Abstract Data Structures are not a separate category of data structures but rather a way of describing the behavior or functionality of a data structure.

* In summary, we can place Abstract Data Structures as a concept that is used to define a specific behavior or set of operations that a data structure should support, but it is not a distinct category of data structures like primitive or composite data structures.

# Classification of Data Structures
* At a high level, data structures in computer science can be classified into two main categories: 
  * [primitive data types](https://github.com/nyangweso-rodgers/Computer_Science_Concepts/tree/master/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/Data-Structures/Primitive-Data-Types) and 
  * [composite data types](https://github.com/nyangweso-rodgers/Computer_Science_Concepts/tree/master/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/Data-Structures/Composite-Data-Types)
