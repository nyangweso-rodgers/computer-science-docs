## Table Of Contents

# Overview Of Queue
* A __queue__ is a __First In, First Out__ (__FIFO__) collection. This is a contrast to a __stack__ collection i.e., __First In, Last Out__ collection. i.e., queue returns items in the same order they were added.

* __Enque__ adding an item into the queue.
* __Deque__ removing an item from the queue

# Applications of Queue
* __Queue__ are used whenever we need to manage objects in order starting with the first one in. Scenarios include:
    * printing documents on a printer
    * call centre stystem aswering people on hold

# Implementations of Queue
* Linked List for the item storage
* Array implementation

# Priority Queue
* differs from the __normal queue__ in that they are not __First In, First Out__, but rather, they return the highest priority items first, regardless of the order of in which they were added to the Queue.
