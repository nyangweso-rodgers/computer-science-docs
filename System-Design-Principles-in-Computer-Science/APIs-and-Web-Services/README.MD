# What is an Event-Driven Architecture?
* __Event-driven architectures__ establish an event that can be consumed and reacted to. But what is an __event__? An __event__ is essentially _any significant change from one state to another, such as the change from having no messages in your inbox to have a new message in your inbox_.
# 5 Protocols For Event-Driven API Architectures
* 5 common event-driven methods include:
    1. __WebSockets__:
    2. __WebHooks__:
    3. __REST Hooks__:
    4. __Pub-Sub__:
    5. __Server Sent Events__:

* If you are building for scalability with low overhead in a browser environment, __WebSockets__ are a great solution. Conversely, if you’d like those same benefits but are working in a non-browser system, then __WebHooks__ should be your approach. __REST Hooks__ are not only great for __RESTful services__, they’re also much easier to set up than either, and thus are _great in low-time high-rush situations_. __Pub-Sub__ can be great if you need to enforce a division between client and server, and this can further be established and controlled in an even stronger way with Server Sent.
