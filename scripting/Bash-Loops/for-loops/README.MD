# for loop
* __For-loops__ are used to repeat a block of code several times. It is important that the number of repetitions must be known;

# General Syntax
```sh
    for variable_name in list_of_values
    do
        commands
    done
```

* When looping through numerical values, you can set the loop's boundary conditions as an interval defined with curly brackets and separated by two dots , i.e. __{start_value..end_value}__.
