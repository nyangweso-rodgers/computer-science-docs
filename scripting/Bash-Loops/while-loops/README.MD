# while loops

* __For-loops__ are great but they are only useful when the number of repetitions (loops) that must be performed is known.  When that number is unknown, you have to use a while-loop. It repeats a block of code as long as some condition is satisfied.

# General Syntax
```sh
    while [ condition ] ; do
        commands
    done
```
