# Assesment 1 - Codity Assessment

# Description
* Write a Bash script that computes the sum of absolute values of integers given a standard input.

* The numbers are given in a single line, separated by a space. You should print the sum of their absolute values to standard output.

* For example, give the input 2 41 -15, the script should print to the standard output: 58 as the absolute values of the numbers in the input are 2 41 and 15, and their sum is 58.

* Assume that:
    - The sum of absolute values of the input not exceed 10^19
    - The machine is running UBUNTU 16.04

* In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
