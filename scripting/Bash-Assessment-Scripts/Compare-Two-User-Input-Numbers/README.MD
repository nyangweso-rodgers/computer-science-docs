# Compare Two User Input Numbers
* Write a program where a user is prompted to enter two numbers and the script must find out which of the numbers is bigger.
* If the difference between the first and second number is negative, then the second number must be bigger, else the first one must be the bigger one. If it is 0, then the numbers are equal.
