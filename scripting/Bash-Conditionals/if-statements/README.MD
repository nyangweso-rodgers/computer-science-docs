# if statement
* If statements are also quite different compared to other languages. It doesn't have =, <, >, >=, <= operators. Instead you write your condition in square brackets like this:
  *  __[$num -eq 1]__
* The basic comparison operators are:
  *  -eq, 
  *  -gt, 
  *  lt, 
  *  -ge, 
  *  -le, 
  *  -ne.
