# Introduction to Software Development Methodologies
* __Waterfall Development__: You figure out everything you need to do and document them (requirements). Like a _waterfall_, there's no way to go back up unless you start over again. You move on to the next phase when current phase is completed.

* __Agile Development__: In __Agile Development__, you figure out some of the things you need to do at the beginning. Then continously improve, evolve, collaborate and adapt as the development goes on. Some of the popular implementations of __Agile Development__ methodology include:
    - Scrum
    - Extreme Programming
    - Kanban

# Scrum
* __Scrum__: is a _lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems._ i.e., __Scrum__ requires a __Scrum Master__ to foster an environment where:
    * A __Product Owner__ orders the work for a complex problem into a __Product Backlog__.
    * The __Scrum Team__ turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
    * The __Scrum Team__ and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
    * Repeat

* _Remarks_:
    * __Scrum__ employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.

* __Scrum Values__:These 5 values give direction to the __Scrum Team__ with regard to their work, actions, and behavior.
    - __Commitment__: _The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other._
    - __Focus__: _Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals_
    - __Openness__: _The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges._ 
    - __Respect__: _Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work_
    - __Courage__: _The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems._
    
* __Scrum Team__ consists of:
    - __Scrum Master__: is _accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide_. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization. 
    - __Product Owner__: _accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team_ 
    - __Developers__: _are the people in the __Scrum Team__ that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint._
