# What is a Feature Flag?
* __Feature flag/toggles/controls__ is a software development process used to _enable_ or _disable_ functionality remotely without deploying code. New features can be deployed without making them visible to users. __Feature flags__ help decouple deployment from release letting you manage the full lifecycle of a feature. 

* A __feature flagging__ tool provides a mechanism to turn features on and off within your application. This is essential if you want to support a Continuous Deployment strategy and need to move unreleased features, or un-tested code into a production environment, but want to turn it off. It also allows you to do A/B testing if you choose by turning certain features on for certain users, while leaving it off for everyone else.

# Advantages Of Feature Flags
* _Feature flags make it safer to deploy continuously by separating code changes from revealing features to users._
* _In feature flag during software testing new code can automatically merge and deploy to production and then wait behind a feature flag._
* _When you make a software then the testing phase in enables by Feature Flag, therefore you can say it is most essential for software development process._
* _Flexible code management in there during execution of software testing._

# Overview Of LaunchDarkly
* __LaunchDarkly__ helps companies get unprecedented control over feature lifecycles. It is a continuous delivery platform that allows developers to easily wrap features in flags in order to take full control of the lifecycle of their features.

* It replaces internally built feature flagging systems and allows your company to practice continuous delivery with feature flag driven development.
