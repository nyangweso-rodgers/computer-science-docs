# Web Servers

- **Apache** and **NGINX** are two of the most popular web servers in use today, each with distinct strengths tailored for different scenarios.

# Apache vs NGINX: Comprehensive Performance and Use Case Analysis

1. **Performance Comparison: Latency, Throughput, Saturation, and Availability**

   - **Latency and Throughput**: In multiple performance tests, **NGINX** generally outperforms **Apache** in terms of **latency and throughput**, particularly for static content. NGINXâ€™s efficient handling of concurrent connections allows for lower latency and higher throughput under load.

2. **Resource Utilization**

   - **CPU and Memory Usage**:
     - **NGINX** generally uses less memory and CPU resources compared to **Apache**, making it a preferred choice for environments with limited resources or high demand for concurrent connections.

3. **Network Traffic**
   - The network traffic management of **NGINX** is more efficient due to its streamlined architecture, contributing to better overall network performance.
