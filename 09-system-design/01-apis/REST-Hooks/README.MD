# Introduction to REST Hooks
* __Hooks__ are collated to a single target URL as a subscription, which pings the resource requester when a change is noted. This approach is a response to the practice of __polling__, in which a client constantly checks for changes to a resource. Under the __REST Hooks__ paradigm, the client instead waits for a change, and reacts to it. To put it simply, this is a __WebHook in REST__.
