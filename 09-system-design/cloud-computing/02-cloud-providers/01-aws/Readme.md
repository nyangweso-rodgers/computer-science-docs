## ECS (Elastic Container Service)

- It’s AWS’s managed service for running **Docker containers**.
- When you run **ECS**, you have two launch types:
  1. **EC2 launch type** → you manage the EC2 instances.
  2. **Fargate launch type** → AWS manages compute for you.

## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

- It’s AWS’s raw virtual machine service. You launch and manage servers (instances) directly.
