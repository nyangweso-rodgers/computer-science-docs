## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- VPC is like a private network in the Cloud, giving the power to control:
  1. Subnet placement (private or public access)
  2. Firewall rules (which traffic is allowed in or out)
  3. Routing (where traffic flows and how)
- i.e., it's like an own data center running on a provider's infrastructure
