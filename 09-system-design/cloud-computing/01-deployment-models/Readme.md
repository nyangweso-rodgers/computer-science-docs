# What is Virtualization?

- **Virtualization** is the logical division of physical computing resources. **Vurtualization** makes a physical server into a _virtual host machine_ so that _virtual host_ can then run _guest virtual machines_.

- **Virtualization** started in 1960's as a way to slice up mainframe resources. There are many resources that can be virtualized:
  - server (compute),
  - storage, and
  - network.
- There are many forms of _virtualization_ - including server and desktop.

- There are 2 main methods of **virtualization**, those being **Virtual Machine** (VM) and **Docker**. Docker is more in use than virtual machines and has more uses than virtual machines but this does not mean Virtual Machines are in any way inferior today.
