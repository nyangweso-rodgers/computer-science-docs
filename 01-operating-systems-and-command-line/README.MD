# Introduction to Operating Systems

- **Operating System**: set of programs that controls and supports hardware and provide various services which are used for better performance of computer. The **operating system** acts as a link between **software** and **hardware**. It controls and record of the execution of all other programs that are present in the computer including application programs and other system software.

- The major **functions of O.S** are:

  - it assigns processors to task
  - manages memory and other storage areas
  - acts as a command interpreter
  - file management
  - input-output management
  - establish data security and integrity
  - maintain account of processor time for billing purposes
  - provides data and time services
  - error detecting aids
  - scheduling

## 1. Kernel

- **Kernel** is the heart of any OS. It's the _piece of software that interacts the closest with the hardware and the rest of the OS sits on top of it_. The **Kernel** is responsible for low-level tasks such as:
  1. disk management,
  2. memory management,
  3. task management, and so on.

# Types of Operating System

1. **Windows**: Microsoft developed the Windows operating system. It was developed so as to overcome the limitation of the MS-DOS operating system.
2. **Mac**: MAC is an OS that focuses on the graphical user interface and was developed by **Apple, Inc**, for their Macintosh systems

- **Remark**:

  - **Linux** and **Mac** are built based off of **Unix**. Unix came before windows, mac, etc…. In **unix based systems** you have whats called **kernel modules** where in windows they’re called **kernel drivers**.
  - **Windows** is all closed source where **linux** is fully open and mac is partially open.
  - **Linux** is free and the other two cost money.
  - **Windows** and **Mac** are best for the general population where **linux** is best suited for developers(Mac is good for this because it’s required for IOS programming).

# Comparison of Windows, Mac & Linux OS

1. **Release History**:

   - Windows first released in 1985. It was supposed to be a graphical user interface on top of MS-DOS. All features of MS-DOS were later integrated with Windows 95 release. It was a huge success in and led to the Windows transition.
   - This operating system from Apple stands older than Windows. It was first released in 1984. It began as a graphical user interface right from its inception. In 2005 the design and structure of MAC OS were changed to Intel x86 based architecture.
   - It was initially developed at Finnish University. It was released in 1991 and designed for GNU developers. GNU developers later integrated it into Linux. It is open to consumers, and everyone can use it as per their specifications.

2. **File systmes**: The way **Windows** organizes files is different from the way **Mac** and **GNU/Linux** do.
   - **Windows** uses "**drives**". They're usually a **C** and **D drive** that store all the computer files, and separate drives for external devices such as **CDs**, **USBs**, and so on.
   - **Mac** and **GNU/Linux** have a similar file system that comes from **UNIX**. In these OSs there are no drives – everything in the computer is considered a file (even external devices) and all files are organized in directories that descend from a single root directory. The directory structure is formed as a tree that has a unique root.
   - This doesn't necessarily make much of a difference for the end user, but is something to keep in mind if you're used to navigating one type of file system or the other.
3. **Shells**:
   - Both **GNU/Linux** and **Mac** have **Bash** as their default shell, while Windows has its own shell that uses a different syntax.
   - As developers and avid terminal users, learning Bash is probably the best choice as this knowledge can be more easily translated to all OSs than the Windows shell. Especially taking into account that GNU/Linux runs on most servers worldwide, which is one of the main occasions when you'd need to use the terminal to interact with the computer.
4. **Package Managers**:
   - Mac and GNU/Linux come with package managers installed by default. They're super helpful, especially when you're installing and uninstalling things constantly, as it's much more efficient to install programs through package managers than manually.
   - Mac's package manager is called **[homebrew](https://brew.sh/)**. On GNU/Linux, the default package manager depends on the distro. For example, **Ubuntu** comes with [APT](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/package-management), **Arch** comes with [Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman), and so on.
   - **Windows** doesn't come with a default package manager. If you want one, you need to install it first. One of the package managers available for Windows is [Chocolatey](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/).
5. **Cost**:
   - most **GNU/Linux** distros are completely free for anyone to use.
   - Windows has a freemium model currently and
   - MacOS runs only on Mac computers, which are quite pricey.
6. **Software compatibility**:
   - Windows is the most widely used OS, and thanks to that most software is adapted to it. Even though less popular, MacOS is similar to Windows in this regard
   - Back in the day, Linux wasn't compatible with many programs out there, but this has started to change recently, especially with the most popular distros like Ubuntu.
7. **Hardware quality and compatibility**:
   - When it comes to hardware, only Apple has direct responsibility for the computers that the OS runs on. And Apple's hardware is some of the best out there. As a company, Apple is focused on providing top quality products, so their newest computers tend to be the ones with best performance all across the market. Given that Apple designs and develops both hardware and software, it's possible that the compatibility between the machine and the OS is tuned finer than with Windows or GNU/Linux.
   - On the Windows and GNU/Linux side, hardware quality is completely up to what the user decides or can afford to buy. The good thing here is that you can install the OS wherever you want.
8. **Ease of use**: Windows and Mac are really simple and user-friendly OSs. Regarding GNU/Linux, it depends on the distro you choose. As mentioned, distros like Ubuntu are practically as easy as Windows or Mac, and others like Arch are intended for advanced computer users.
9. **Security and stability**:
   - Some GNU/Linux distros are considered the most secure and stable ones nowadays. The fact that the code is available to everyone isn't a security threat as you may think at first – but rather it's an advantage. Bugs can be identified and worked on quicker, and when a security breach is identified lots of people can work on it and propose fixes.
   - Windows, on the other hand, is considered the least secure and stable of the three. Given that it's the most popular OS, most malware is developed to attack Windows OS too.
10. **Community and culture**: If you're interested in learning more about a particular OS, studying how it works, how to modify it and create projects based on it, GNU/Linux is definitely the way to go. It's the only one that has its code available to anyone and its online community is huge.
