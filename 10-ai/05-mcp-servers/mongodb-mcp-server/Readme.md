# MongoDB MCP Server

## Table Of Contents

#

- **MongoDB** released an **MCP Server** that lets AI tools like **Claude**, **Cursor**, and **GitHub Copilot** talk directly to a MongoDB deployment. That means anyone (technical or non-technical) can now say:

  - Show me the most active users
  - Create a new database user with read-only access
  - Whatâ€™s the schema for my orders collection?
