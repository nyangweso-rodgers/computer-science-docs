# Introduction to Supervised Learning
* _Supervised learning_ involves somehow modeling the relationship between measured features of data and some label associated with the data; once this model is determined, it can be used to apply labels to new, unknown data.

* We apply __Supervised ML__ techniques when we have a piece of data that we want to predict or explain. We do so by using the previous data of inputs and outputs to predict an output based on a new input._

* __Supervised Learning__ can then be classified into two algorithms:

    1. __Classification__: _Used to predict which class a data point belongs to, which is usually a _discrete value._. classification problem requires the examples to classified into one of two or more classes and can be divided further into __binary-classification__ problem and __multi-label classification__ problem*. Examples
        - predicting whether an email is spam or not.
        - predicting whether it's going to rain or not.
        - customer segmentation - classifying your customers into different groups.
        - predicting whether a review is either positive, negative or neutral.

    2. __Regression__: In _regression_, the labels are _continuous_ quantities. Examples include:
        - predicting the price of a house
        - predicting the sales of a particular product.
        - salary estimation.
