# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
* Here, we start with no training/input data and our agent learns what to do based on the environment and how to map certain situations into actions in order to maximize reward.

* Generally, __RL__ is a ML method that helps an agent learn from experience. By recording actions and using trial-and-error approach in a set environment, __RL__ can maximize a cumulative reward. You can use RL when you have little to no historical data about a problem, because it doesn't need information in advance (unlike traditional ML methods).

* In a __RL__ framework, you learn from the data as you go. Not surprisingly, RL is especially successful with games, especially games of "perfect information" like chess and Go. with gamesm, feedback from the agent and the environment comes quickly, allowing the model to learn fast.

* The downside of RL is that it can take a very long time to train if the problem is complex.
