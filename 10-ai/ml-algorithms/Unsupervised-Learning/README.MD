# Introduction to Unsupervised Learning
* Are ML methods that don't make explicit outcome predictions, but instead find hidden relationships in the data. _Unsupervised learning_ involves modeling the features of a dataset without reference to any label, and is often described as “letting the dataset speak for itself.”

* Unsupervised ML looks at ways to relate and group data points without the use of a target variable to predict.i.e, it evaluates data in terms of traits and uses the traits to form clusters of items that are similar to one another.

* Examples include:
    1. can be used in customer segmentation.

    2. Fraud detection.

    3. used in building recommendation systems

# Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
1. __Clusteting Algorithms__: identify distinct groups of data.

2. __Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms__: search for more succinct representations of the data.
