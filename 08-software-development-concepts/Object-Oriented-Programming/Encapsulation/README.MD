# Encapsulation

* __Encapsulation__ is the practice of hiding information inside of a "_black box_" so that other developers working with the code don't have to worry about it. That's the goal of encapsulation: it makes our lives easier as developers and helps us write cleaner code.

* A basic _example of encapsulation would be a function_. The caller of a function doesn't need to worry too much about what happens inside â€“ they just need to understand the inputs and outputs.

# Encapsulation in OOP
* In the context of OOP, we can practice good encapsulation by using _private_ and _public_ members.

* The idea is that if we want the users of our class to interact with something directly, we make it public. If they don't need to use a certain method or property, we make that private in order to keep the usage instructions for our class simple.

# Encapsulation does NOT make systems more secure
* Adding encapsulation to our programs through "public" and "private" members makes our code easier to work with. It makes it "cleaner".

* To be clear, encapsulation doesn't make the code more secure in the cryptographic or cyber-security sense of the word
