# POP (Post Office Protocol)

- **POP** is **application-layer protocol** used for retrieving emails. However, unlike **IMAP**, **POP** is designed to download emails from the server to a single device and typically deletes them from the server afterward.

- **Purpose**:

  - Allows users to download emails for offline access, especially useful when internet connectivity is unreliable.
  - Does not sync emails across devices (e.g., if you download an email to your laptop, it wonâ€™t be accessible on your phone).
