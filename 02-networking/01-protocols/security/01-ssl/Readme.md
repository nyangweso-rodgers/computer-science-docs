# SSL - Secure Sockets Layer

- **SSL** is a security protocol that encrypts communication between devices to ensure data privacy and integrity. It operates between the **transport layer** and the **application layer** in the **OSI model**. It works with protocols like **HTTP**, **SMTP**, and **FTP** to secure their communication.

- **TLS** (**Transport Layer Security**) is the successor to SSL and is more secure. Today, when people say "**SSL**," they often mean **TLS**.

- Purpose

  - Encrypts data to prevent interception (e.g., HTTPS websites).
  - Ensures secure communication over the internet for sensitive tasks like online banking, shopping, and email.

- Examples of Use:
  - **HTTPS**: Secure version of **HTTP**.
  - **FTPS**: Secure File Transfer Protocol.
  - **SMTPS**: Secure version of SMTP for sending emails.
