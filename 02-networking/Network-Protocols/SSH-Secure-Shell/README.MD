# SSH - Secure Shell

* __Secure Shell (SSH)__: open-source _protocol_ used to secure network communication which is less expensive and complex than the hardware based __VPN__ solutions. i.e., it offers _authentication_, _encryption_ and _data integrity_ for securing network communicationsy. 

* By Implementing __SSH__, we get some of the capabilities like:
    - secure command-shell
    - secure file transfer
    - remote access to a variety of __TCP/IP__ applications via a secure tunnel
