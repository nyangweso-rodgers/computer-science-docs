# Overview Of Localhost
* __localhost__ is the computer or hostname currently making a request to itself. In this case, the computer is also the virtual server. Just like __HTTP__ and __HTTPS__, the __localhost__ is a protocol.

# What is the IP Address 127.0.0.1?
* if you type __localhost__ to your browserâ€™s address bar, it transforms to the IP address __127.0.0.1__. This __127.0.0.1__ IP address is reserved for local servers on computers, so you will never find another IP address that starts with 127
